a) By using Amdahl's Law and with a theorical infiny number of processors, we could speedup our program by a maximum of 1/0.015 = 66.66 times. 

For a minimum of 60% efficiency we can use the following formula : E(p,N) = S(p,N)/p = T(1,N)/T(p,N) = 1 / (f + (1-f)/p. --> 0.6 = (1/(0.015 + (0.985)/p))/p -> if we solve that equation, we find p = 4.544. Therefore, we should have at least 5 processors.

b)
